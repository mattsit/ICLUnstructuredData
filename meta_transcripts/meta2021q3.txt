th, 2021
Deborah Crawford, VP, Investor Relations
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook’s third quarter earnings conference call. Joining
me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner,
CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will
include forward‐looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by
these forward‐looking statements.
Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s press release, and in
our quarterly report on form 10‐Q filed with the SEC. Any forward‐looking statements that we make on
this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these
statements as a result of new information or future events.
During this call we may present both GAAP and non‐GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP
to non‐GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The press release and an
accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.
And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO
Hey everyone and thanks for joining today.
We made good progress this quarter across a number of product priorities, and our community
continues to grow. There are now almost 3.6 billion people who actively use one or more of our
services, and I'm excited about our roadmap to keep building great new experiences for them.
As expected, we did experience revenue headwinds this quarter, including from Apple's changes that
are not only negatively affecting our business, but millions of small businesses in what is already a
difficult time for them in the economy. Sheryl and Dave will talk about this more later, but the bottom
line is we expect we'll be able to navigate these headwinds over time with investments that we're
already making today.
Before I get to our product update, I want to discuss the recent debate around our company.
I believe large organizations should be scrutinized and I'd much rather live in a society where they are
than one where they can’t be. Good faith criticism helps us get better. But my view is that what we're
seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our
company.
The reality is that we have an open culture where we encourage discussion and research about our work
so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us. We have industry-
2
leading programs to study the effects of our products and provide transparency into our progress
because we care about getting this right.
When we make decisions, we need to balance competing social equities, like free expression with
reducing harmful content, or enabling strong encrypted privacy with supporting law enforcement, or
enabling research and interoperability with locking down data as much as possible. It makes a good
soundbite to say that we don't solve these impossible tradeoffs because we're just focused on making
money, but the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business, but about balancing
different difficult social values. And I've repeatedly called for regulation to provide clarity because I don't
think companies should be making so many of these decisions ourselves.
I'm proud of our record navigating the complex tradeoffs involved in operating services at global scale,
and I'm proud of the research and transparency we bring to our work. Our programs are industryleading. We have made massive investments in safety and security with more than 40,000 people and
we are on track to spend more than $5 billion on safety and security in 2021. I believe that's more than
any other tech company, even adjusted for scale. We set the standard for transparency with our
quarterly enforcement reports and tools like our political ads archive. We established a new model for
independent academic researchers to safely access data. We pioneered the Oversight Board as a model
of self-regulation. And as a result, we believe that our systems are the most effective at reducing
harmful content across the industry. And I think that any honest account of how we've handled these
issues should include that.
I also think that any honest account should be clear that these issues aren't primarily about social media.
That means that no matter what Facebook does, we're never going to solve them on our own. For
example, polarization started rising in the US before I was born. At the same time, independent research
shows that many countries around the world have flat or declining polarization, despite similar social
media use there to in the US. We see this pattern repeat with other issues as well. The reality is, if social
media is not the main driver of these issues, then it probably can't fix them by itself either.
We should want every other company in our industry to make the investments and achieve the results
that we have. I worry about the incentives that we're creating for other companies to be as
introspective as we have been. But I am committed to continuing this work, because I believe it will be
better for our community and our business over the long term.
We can't change the underlying media dynamics, but there's a different constituency that we serve that
has always been more important and that I try to keep us focused on: and that’s people.
Billions of people use our services because we build the best tools to stay connected to the people you
care about, to find communities that matter to you, and to grow your small business.
And the reason we've been able to succeed for almost two decades is because we keep evolving and
building. Facebook started in a dorm room and grew into a global website. We invented the News Feed
and a new kind of ads platform. We became a mobile-first experience. And then we grew a whole family
of apps that serve billions of people.
And there is so much more to build. Even with all the tools we have today, we still can't feel like we're
right there together with the people we care about when we're physically apart. We can't teleport as
holograms to instantly be at the office without a commute, or at a concert with a friend, or in your 
3
parents' living room to catch up. The creative economy and commerce tools are still nascent and there
should be opportunity for millions of more people to make a living doing the work that they love.
Our three product priorities remain our focus on creators, commerce, and building the next computing
platform.
A big part of our work with creators is our focus on Reels. Reels is already the primary driver of
engagement growth on Instagram. It's incredibly entertaining, and I think that there's a huge amount of
potential ahead. We expect this to continue growing and I am optimistic that Reels will be as important
for our products as Stories is. We also expect to make significant changes to Instagram and Facebook in
the next year to further lean into video and make Reels a more central part of the experience.
One aspect of this is giving all our apps the goal of being the best services for young adults, which we
define as ages 18-29. Historically, young adults have been a strong base and that's important because
they are the future. But over the last decade, as the audience that uses our apps has expanded so much
and we've focused on serving everyone, our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most
people who use them rather than specifically for young adults. And during this period, competition has
also gotten more intense, especially with Apple's iMessage growing in popularity and more recently, the
rise of TikTok, which is one of the most effective competitors we have ever faced.
So we are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their north star, rather than optimizing for
the larger number of older people. Like everything, this will involve tradeoffs in our products and it will
likely mean that the rest of our community will grow more slowly than it otherwise would have. But it
should also mean that our services become stronger for young adults. This shift will take years, not
months, to fully execute, and I think it's the right approach to building our community and company for
the long term.
Our next product priority is commerce. Helping people discover new products that they're interested in
and reach customers inside our apps is going to unlock a lot of opportunity.
As Apple's changes make e-commerce and customer acquisition less effective on the web, solutions that
allow businesses to set up shop right inside our apps will become increasingly attractive and important
to them. We've built solutions like ads that can dynamically point to either a business's website or their
Shop on our platforms depending on what will perform better for them, and that will help more
businesses navigate this challenging environment.
Building a full-fledged commerce platform is a multi-year journey. Marketplace is already at scale and
lots of people rely on it, especially now with supply chain issues that make it harder to get new products.
Shops are getting more developed, and we have an exciting program planned for this holiday season
where we're working closely with a number of the businesses that have invested the most in Shops to
identify what works to find new customers and grow their business even faster. Our plan is to then scale
those solutions even more broadly in 2022.
Beyond Reels and commerce, I also want to share some thoughts on our longer-term efforts to build the
next computing platform and help bring the metaverse to life. This is a major area of investment for us
and an important part of our strategy going forward.
4
I view this work as critical to our mission because delivering a sense of presence -- like you're right there
with another person -- that’s the holy grail of online social experiences. Over the next decade, these new
platforms are going to start to unlock the kinds of experiences that I've wanted to build since even
before I started Facebook. Along with those social experiences I expect a massive increase in the creator
economy and amount of digital goods and commerce. If you're in the metaverse every day, then you'll
need digital clothes, digital tools, and different experiences. Our goal is to help the metaverse reach a
billion people and hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce this decade. Strategically, helping
to shape the next platform should also reduce our dependence on delivering our services through
competitors.
Building the foundational platforms for the metaverse will be a long road. We just released the 128GB
Quest 2, replacing the 64GB model for $299. With EssilorLuxottica, we released our first smart glasses,
and they're off to a strong start as well. But bringing this vision to life isn't just about building one
glasses product. There's a whole ecosystem. We're building multiple generations of our VR and AR
products at the same time, as well as a new operating system and development model, a digital
commerce platform, content studios, and of course a social platform.
So to reflect the significance of this for our business, today we're announcing a change to our financial
reporting. Starting next quarter, we'll begin disclosing financial metrics for Facebook Reality Labs
separately from our Family of Apps. This will provide investors with additional visibility into the
investments that we're making in augmented and virtual reality. In 2021, we expect these investments
to reduce our overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion, and I expect this investment to grow
even further for each of the next several years. Dave will share more about this later, but I encourage
you all to tune into Connect on Thursday to hear more about our vision and our work here in more
detail.
I recognize the magnitude of this bet on the future, and I am grateful for the support of our investors,
the creative community, and the thousands of talented people working on this effort inside our
company to bring this inspiring future to life.
And with that, here's Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg, COO
Thanks Mark, and hi everyone.
This quarter our total revenue was $29 billion, up 35% year-over-year. We saw solid revenue growth
across all regions. And we continued to grow our user base.
We felt the impact of some big external factors in Q3. I want to explain some of the revenue softness
we’ve seen, and what we’re doing to mitigate the headwinds and help businesses over the crucial
holiday period and beyond.
To start, let’s take a step back. Over the past decade, we’ve seen more and more businesses shift online.
When the pandemic hit, this digital transformation accelerated. We’ve invested in tools and products
over many years to help businesses make this shift. So this acceleration drove very strong growth for us
throughout the last few quarters.
5
We’ve been open about the fact that there were headwinds coming – and we’ve experienced that in Q3.
The biggest is the impact of Apple’s iOS14 changes, which have created headwinds for others in the
industry as well, major challenges for small businesses, and advantaged Apple’s own advertising
business. We started to see that impact in Q2, but adoption on the consumer side ramped up by late
June, so it hit critical mass in Q3. As a result, we’ve encountered two challenges. One is that the
accuracy of our ads targeting decreased, which increased the cost of driving outcomes for our
advertisers. And the other is that measuring those outcomes became more difficult.
On targeting, we’re focused on improving campaign performance even with the increased limitations
facing our industry. We’re building commerce tools to help businesses reach more new customers and
get more incremental sales. And over the longer term, we’re developing Privacy Enhancing Technologies
in collaboration with others across the industry to help minimize the amount of personal information we
process, while still allowing us to show relevant ads. Progress in these areas will take time and will be a
focus for us throughout 2022 and beyond.
On measurement, as we wrote in a recent blog post, we believe we are underreporting iOS web
conversions. This means real world conversions, like sales and app installs, are higher than what’s being
reported for many advertisers, especially small advertisers. We’re making good progress fixing this. We
think we’ll be able to address more than half of the underreporting by the end of this year. And we’ll
continue to work on this into 2022.
Another external factor is slowing e-Commerce growth. The strong e-Commerce growth in recent
quarters was driven in part by the acceleration of the digital transformation that is now tapering off. I
think most people see this in their own lives. There was a period of time when many people who were
able to stayed at home and ordered things online much more. But now in many places things have
opened up, and people are increasingly making purchases in person. That doesn’t mean e-Commerce
has stopped growing. Businesses are still making the shift online. But e-Commerce is no longer growing
at the pace it was at the height of the pandemic.
These factors have been compounded for many advertisers by major global supply chain issues and
labor shortages, which have left many consumer businesses with less inventory. This has reduced their
appetite to generate demand from consumers, which has impacted advertising spend. Businesses in
every region and across a range of verticals have been affected. At the same time we’ve also seen some
impact from Covid surges around the world in places like South-East Asia.
Overall, if it wasn’t for Apple’s iOS14 changes, we would have seen positive quarter-over-quarter
revenue growth. And while we and our advertisers will continue to feel the effect of these changes in
future quarters, we will continue working hard to mitigate them.
Despite the headwinds, we remain confident about our future. We believe Facebook and Instagram are
the best place for people to connect with their friends and families, build communities, and start and
grow businesses. And we believe they’re still the best platforms for advertisers to reach people where
they are and get measurable outcomes. Our focus remains where it always has been, building products
that help people connect and businesses grow.
Mark talked about video a moment ago. Not only is this a growing area for us overall, but we’re also
continuing to get better at monetizing it. More than 60% of video revenue now comes from mobile-first
video, meaning videos that are shot vertically or are under 15 seconds. Over 2 billion people per month 
6
now watch videos that are eligible for In-Stream ads, which are ads shown before, during or after
videos. And we’re expanding access to Reels ads on Instagram to more advertisers with automatic
placement and new creative formats.
Another area we’re seeing good progress is in lead generation. Our products help businesses generate
quality leads at scale and meet customers where they are on their preferred channel of communication,
whether it’s messaging, forms, or calls. In April, we started rolling out a new Conversion Leads
optimization goal for higher quality leads, and advertisers can also integrate their CRM with Facebook
via our Conversions API. Our tests show that on average advertisers see a 20% increase in lead to sale
conversion rate when they use both the optimization goal and the integration.

Q4 is the most important quarter of the year for many businesses, large and small. As always, we’re
focused on making the holiday season a success for them. We’re working to fix the measurement issues
they’re experiencing, and deliver the tools and products they need to grow. And we’re rolling out a
range of holiday shopping experiences to help people find great deals, support small businesses and
good causes, and shop with local and Black-owned businesses.
We’re bringing exclusive gifts to Shops that will be available when people checkout on Facebook or
Instagram, like 20% off your first purchase and free shipping. Starting next week, we’ll host daily Live
Shopping experiences with companies large and small – brands like Walmart, Macy’s, Benefit Cosmetics
and Paintbox Nails – to educate shoppers and share exclusive deals.
And we’re bringing back one of my favorite campaigns ever – Buy Black Friday – to showcase Blackowned small businesses during the holidays. It includes things like Buy Black collections in the Facebook
and Instagram Shop tabs, and a weekly Buy Black Friday show with Live Shopping segments from up and
coming Black-owned small businesses.
I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our partners around the world. And to our incredible
teams who are working so hard to help people and businesses throughout this period.
Now, here’s Dave.
Dave Wehner, CFO
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone.
We delivered solid results in the third quarter in the face of a challenging mobile platform landscape and
an evolving macroeconomic environment.
Let’s begin with our community metrics.
Our global community continued to grow even as we lapped elevated user growth in the third quarter of
last year related to the pandemic. We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least one
of our services on a daily basis in September, and that approximately 3.6 billion people used at least one
on a monthly basis. 
7
Facebook daily active users reached 1.93 billion, up 6% or 110 million compared to last year. DAUs
represented approximately 66% of the 2.91 billion monthly active users in September. MAUs grew by
170 million or 6% compared to last year.
Turning to the financials.
All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.
Q3 total revenue was $29.0 billion, up 35% or 34% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a
currency tailwind and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 of last year, total revenue
would have been $259 million lower.
Q3 ad revenue was $28.3 billion, up 33% or 32% on a constant currency basis.
On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 50%.
Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific grew 35%, 31%, and 28%, respectively. Europe, Asia-Pacific and
Rest of World benefited from currency tailwinds, though to a lesser degree than in the prior quarter.
In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 9% and the average price
per ad increased 22%.
Impression growth was driven primarily by developing markets, especially in Asia-Pacific. Pricing growth
benefited from advertiser demand and lapping of Covid-related pricing weakness during the third
quarter of last year. Though, as Sheryl noted, growth was hindered by three primary headwinds:
First, advertising spend was negatively impacted by performance and measurement headwinds related
to Apple’s ATT changes.
Second, we are seeing some macro headwinds as growth in online commerce has moderated from the
elevated levels experienced earlier in the pandemic and businesses face supply chain disruptions.
Third, Covid resurgences in Southeast Asia have led to additional lockdowns and a curtailment of
economic activity.
Other revenue was $734 million, up 195%, driven by strong Quest 2 sales.
Turning now to expenses.
Q3 total expenses were $18.6 billion, up 38% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items:
Cost of revenue increased 38%, driven mostly by consumer hardware costs, core infrastructure
investments, and payments to partners.
R&D increased 33%, driven primarily by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware
efforts.
Marketing & Sales increased 32%, mainly driven by marketing spend and hiring.
8
Lastly, G&A expenses increased 65%, driven primarily by higher legal-related costs and employeerelated costs.
We added over 4,700 net new hires in Q3, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with
over 68,100 full-time employees, up 20% compared to last year.
Third quarter operating income was $10.4 billion, representing a 36% operating margin. Our tax rate
was 13%. Net income was $9.2 billion or $3.22 per share.
Capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.5 billion, driven by investments in data centers,
servers, network infrastructure and office facilities.
Free cash flow was $9.5 billion and we ended the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable
securities.
We repurchased $14.4 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and had $8.0 billion
remaining on our prior authorization as of September 30th. Today we announced a $50 billion increase
in our stock repurchase authorization.
Turning now to the outlook.
Starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2021, we plan to break out Facebook Reality Labs, or
FRL, as a separate reporting segment. As we have discussed, we are dedicating significant resources
towards our augmented and virtual reality products and services, which are an important part of our
work to develop the next generation of online social experiences. The new segment disclosures will
provide additional information on the performance of FRL and the investments we are making.
Under this reporting structure, we will provide revenue and operating profit for two segments:
The first segment, Family of Apps, will include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other
services.
The second segment, Facebook Reality Labs, will include augmented and virtual reality related
hardware, software and content. As Mark noted, we expect our investment in FRL to reduce our overall
operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. We are committed to bringing this long-term
vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years.
Ahead of the fourth quarter earnings call, we will share additional details about the reporting format of
our segmented financials.
Turning now to the revenue outlook.
We expect fourth quarter 2021 total revenue to be in the range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Our
outlook reflects the significant uncertainty we face in the fourth quarter in light of continued headwinds
from Apple’s iOS14 changes, and macroeconomic and Covid-related factors. In addition, we expect nonads revenue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we lap the strong launch of Quest 2
during last year's holiday shopping season.
9
As previously noted, we also continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic
data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations.
Turning now to the expense outlook.
We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70-71 billion, updated from our prior outlook of
$70-73 billion. We anticipate our full-year 2022 total expenses will be in the range of $91-97 billion,
driven by investments in technical and product talent and infrastructure-related costs.
We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $19 billion, updated from our prior estimate
of $19-21 billion. For 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $29-34 billion, driven by
our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. A large factor
driving the increase in capex spend is an investment in our AI and Machine Learning capabilities, which
we expect to benefit our efforts in ranking and recommendations for experiences across our products,
including in Feed and video, as well as improving ads performance and relevance.
We expect our Q4 2021 tax rate to be in the high-teens. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we would
expect our full year tax rate in 2022 to be similar to the full year 2021 rate.
Please note that our outlook for 2022 expenses, capital expenditures and tax rate are preliminary
estimates as we have not yet finalized our 2022 budget.
In closing, this was another solid quarter for our business despite facing some headwinds. And we
believe the investments we’re making in our current services, as well as new products and experiences,
will enable us to remain the best place for people to connect and for businesses to advertise – both now
and in the years ahead.
With that, France, let’s open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. To ask a
question, press one followed by the number four on your touchtone phone. Please
pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If you are
streaming today’s call, please mute your computer speakers. And your first question
comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on Reels. It sounds like it's
a pretty important part of long-term adoption. Curious to hear about anything you'll
share about current user adoption, current engagement, or more color on the
demographics of people who are using Reels now.
Then the second one, just a little more question on Apple and the ATT changes. I
appreciate the color on accuracy and measurement improvements.
Any more specifics you can share about where you've made the most progress from
your investment to date and sort of some of the areas where you're seeing more
challenges, you need to continue to invest to really improve to navigate through this
more challenging environment? Thanks.
10
Dave Wehner: Yes. Sure, Brian. On Reels, that's been a bright spot for Instagram. And currently,
we're seeing good growth globally -- strength in a number of different markets, but
we've been making a lot of progress on Reels and have been happy with it on
Instagram.
In terms of launch on Facebook, that's earlier stage. On the monetization front,
we're just starting to roll out ads in Instagram. So it's earlier on that front, and we
really haven't gotten to a monetization point with Reels on Facebook. Sheryl, do you
want to take the iOS 14 question?
Sheryl Sandberg: Yes. I can take that. I mean when you start at the top of this, you really have to think
about what personalized ads are. And we think they're better for people and
businesses, and they're especially important to small businesses. They also can be
delivered, can be done in a very privacy safe way.
There are two big challenges coming from this iOS changes. The one is targeting and
one is measurement. I'm taking the second one first. On measurement, we think we
can address more than half of that underreporting by the end of the year and make
more progress in the years ahead.
We estimate we're underreporting iOS web conversions. We believe that real-world
conversions like sales and app installs are higher. And so we have to do the work to
help clients measure these properly in order for them to really understand the
outcomes they're getting and improving performance. And again, we think we can
get a good chunk of that done this year and more in the next year.
Targeting is a longer-term challenge. Our direct response products are built on user
level conversions. And as a result of the iOS changes, we don't see the same level of
conversion data coming through.
So we have to rebuild our targeting and optimization systems to work with less
data. So this is a multiyear effort. We are developing privacy-enhancing technology
to minimize the amount of personal information we learn and using more aggregate
or anonymized data while still allowing us to show those relevant personalized ads
and measure ads effectiveness.
In order for this to really work and benefit all businesses, it can require some crossindustry collaboration and more commerce tools, and those are going to be longerterm efforts.
Dave Wehner: Operator, we can go to the next questions.
Operator: Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe two, if I can. Maybe Sheryl, following up there, in terms of
thinking in terms of quarters or years on both the targeting and the measurement
piece, can you help us just go one level lower in terms of what you're building in
terms of what's in your control to put out into the advertising ecosystem versus 
11
what might just take time for advertisers to adopt and get comfortable with and
better understand the data that drive their business outcomes and how they
allocate advertising budget? That would be for you.
And then, Dave, maybe if I could follow up on OpEx and CapEx. Just how should we
be thinking about the elements of core Facebook versus some of the things you're
trying to build against Mark's vision for the long term with Reality Labs and how that
might be a driver of permanence versus transient nature of OpEx and CapEx in the
years ahead? Thanks so much.
Sheryl Sandberg: So some of the technology we can build ourselves. We build AI. We make continued
investments in AI that help us maintain or improve long-term performance data.
We're building some of our own commerce tools, and those are tools we can build
that we need other people to adopt.
And then some of the targeting opportunities we see have to take tools we can
build or tools we can build in industry collaboration. We're really working as part of
several industry collaborative groups on what those tools will look like and how
those get adopted. So those obviously take more partnership and are less in our
direct control.
Dave Wehner: Hey, Eric, on the outlook on expenses in 2022, it's obviously early, but we wanted to
give an initial outlook of our expected expense range since we typically do that in
Q3. Mark outlined we have a lot of priorities that we're investing against across the
business that includes a lot of areas in the core sort of Family of Apps.
But also in FRL, we've got a lot of priorities in advertising, AI, commerce, privacy. So
when you kind of pull all these things together, we've got a pretty robust spending
plan next year. The primary driver is going to be accelerating headcount growth in
2022.
So that's going to be something you'll see headcount coming in above 20%,
obviously, that we had this quarter. And we also expect to have higher expenses
from office operations and travel once larger parts of the workforce are returning to
the office in 2022. We're not providing a specific breakdown at this point for
segment expense. And France, you can go to the next question.
Operator: Our next question from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Douglas Anmuth: Great, thank you. One for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, just given the significant
investments in both P&L expenses and CapEx, and clearly, you're talking about the
heavy focus on metaverse over the long term, I was just hoping you could help us
recap kind of the 1-year, 3-year and then 5-year aspirations from a product
perspective as you've done in the past?
And then, Dave, just on the 2022 expenses, which is about 29% to 38% growth, do
you have any commentary on revenue growth in '22 to go along with that? Thanks.
12
Mark Zuckerberg: I can talk about the metaverse and Reality Labs part of this. So for the next 1 and 3
years, especially, I think what you'll see is us putting more of the foundational pieces
into place. This is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us anytime in
the near future.
But we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor of the
mobile Internet, that it's going to enable social experiences that are the ultimate
expression of what we try to build, which is allowing people to feel really present
with the people they care about no matter where they actually are.
And we think it's going to unlock a massively larger creative economy of both digital
and physical goods than what exists today and allow millions of people to be able to
do work doing what they love and enabling a whole different economy around that,
that I think is going to be another important pillar of our business, over the next
decade.
So on the next 1 to 3 years, I mean, I almost -- wouldn't focus on the sort of business
outcomes there quite as much as I would just -- the products and infrastructure that
we're putting in place. So there's -- there are new platforms, there's hardware
components.
There's the whole virtual reality product line. There's the augmented reality product
line. We're kind of starting to put those pieces in place. There's the operating
system and development model for all these new creative tools. There's the
commerce parts of what we're doing around this and how they tie into broader
commerce effort across Family of Apps.
And then there's all the social platform work that we're doing with our Horizon
effort that touches a bunch of different areas of what we're doing. But I think you'll
see all of those pieces start to get built out and start to mature a bit over the next
few years. And then if we do a good job on this, and I would say later in this decade,
is when we would sort of expect this to be more of a real business story.
But I think what we kind of think about for the near term is are we delivering the
product experiences that are completely groundbreaking and that people try this,
and they just think this is amazing and can see a glimpse of where this is going, and
that will pave the way for the future. The sort of the business North Star that I
mentioned in some of my opening remarks are, we hope that by the end of the
decade that we can help a billion people use the metaverse and support hundreds
of billions of dollars of digital commerce. And I think if we can do that, then this will
be a good investment over the long term.
Dave Wehner: Hey Doug, it's Dave. We're not at this point providing a specific revenue outlook for
2022. We continue to see opportunities to grow both impressions and price next
year, but we're obviously coming off an incredibly strong year of revenue growth in
2021. 
13
So we do expect deceleration in growth in 2022 from the full year 2021 rate. And
this -- there's sort of uncertainty implied in our range for Q4 revenue, and I think
that holds true for the 2022 outlook as well.
There's a lot of factors at play, including advertisers working their way through the
impact of the Apple platform changes. We're obviously navigating a challenging
macroeconomic environment.
We'll have a better sense of how these things work together as we get through the
holiday season. But given the expense growth that we outlined, which is implied in
the 30 -- north of 30% we don't expect revenue growth at that level. So we would
expect 2022 margins to be lower than 2021. France, you can go to the next
question.
Operator: Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go
ahead.
Justin Post: Great. Thank you. Maybe one for Mark and one for Dave. Getting 18- to 29-year old
users is not easy. I wonder if you could maybe outline some of your strategies to
kind of get some progress there. I know it's multi-quarter.
And then, Dave, in your guidance for Q4, can you help us on the IDFA impact? Is it
contemplated to be about the same as 3Q, a little bit better as you work on your
measurement? Or is it a little bit more of a headwind in Q4? Thank you.
Dave Wehner: Yes, Justin, I can take the -- I can actually take both of those questions. In terms of
the younger demographics, our products are obviously widely used by young adults.
And we remain focused on building out those product capabilities and continuing to
focus on making our products relevant for that audience. I think Reels is a big part of
that strategy.
And we've now got that -- we've got that rolled out in over 100 countries since
launching in August of last year, and we're continuing to invest in that experience
and make ongoing product enhancements. And so that's probably one of our big
focus points that I would point to. In terms of the IDFA...
Mark Zuckerberg: Maybe I'll just add something on Reels. Yes. I think that this is going to be a very
meaningful qualitative change in how people use a lot of different products across
the Internet. I mean I think every once in a while, a format comes along that allows
new types of content, right? So we saw this with News Feed. We saw it with Stories.
And I think Reels is -- from everything I've seen has the potential to be something of
that scale where there are different flavors of it and different apps. But I think as a
format, it can be very fundamental.
And I think we're still closer to the beginning of that journey than we are to its
maturity in terms of just having rolled out some of the initial tests and experiences 
14
and rolled it out in Facebook. And I mean you mentioned all the countries that it's in
in Instagram, but it's just continuing to grow very quickly.
So I think that, that's going to be a big part of the focus here. And I think we'll -- I'm
excited over the next year or two to see how that grows into something that I would
bet will be like Stories in our product today. Sorry, Dave, go for it.
Dave Wehner: Yeah, Justin, on the iOS question as it relates to Q4 versus Q3, the bulk of iOS 14
updates were completed as we entered Q3, which contributed to the step up in the
impact from Q2 to Q3. Since iOS 14 is now widely adopted, we don’t expect a similar
step up in Q4.
But importantly, we haven’t gone through a holiday season with these changes and
prices are higher during the holidays, given strong demand. And so there’s
uncertainty how that will intersect with the challenges on targeting and
measurements coming from the iOS changes. So, I think that brings some
uncertainty into the Q4 outlook that’s reflected in our guidance range. You can go to
the next question, France.
Operator: Our next question -- thank you. Our next question is from Youssef Squali with the
Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Youssef Squali: Great, thank you very much. Two questions for me. Mark, it’s the week of Facebook
Connect, so I was hoping you can provide us an update on Horizon. This is the -- that
social app where people can create games and experiences to share together.
When will that finally come out of the closed beta? I think it’s been in for the last
two years. It seems to us that to move Facebook into the metaverse successfully,
you really need to have a VR social app that’s obviously cool and successful.
And the other question is around, again, this focus on the 18 to 29. Can you maybe
just speak to the current trends in engagement at both Facebook and Instagram
among millennials and younger audiences? I know you’re speaking about a focus on
it going forward, but how has it been trending of late? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg: I'll take the first, and then Dave can talk about whatever numbers you want to
share. So first, let me say, I think we have -- on Thursday, at Connect, we're going to
-- be going into quite a bit of detail about our vision for the metaverse and how we
think we can help contribute to building this.
So I encourage all of you to tune in. Part of that, that we are going to talk about is
Horizon, how that fits into this. And we've been steadily working on this and
onboarding more creators and more people to it, and we're adding more worlds all
the time.
I think you're right, this is going to be a critical part of at least our platform and the
work that we're doing here. We released Workrooms recently. I'm really excited
about how that experience has come together. 
15
And I think to your point, you mentioned it's important to have a VR social
experience. I actually think it's important to have an experience that goes across all
of the platforms, right? I don't think what you're going to end up with is just a --
something that's like a VR social network.
I think you want to be able to have these experiences where you can feel present
with people and have this immersive experience that's going to be best if you're in
VR or in AR and you’re a hologram, but it needs still to work everywhere, right? It
needs to be able to work across our whole Family of Apps. It needs to be able to
work on the web and on phones and on computers. So there's a lot to do.
And whether we call it beta or not, I think the reality is we're going to be -- this is
kind of similar to the question before about where we're going to be in a year or 3
years. There's a lot of foundational infrastructure that just needs to get built up
here.
And part of what we're trying to reflect in the segment reporting and all that is
we're committed to doing this work. It's going to be a big investment. We want to
be transparent about it. But we think it's very exciting. It's a huge opportunity for
the future, and I encourage you to tune in on Thursday to hear more.
Dave Wehner: And Youssef, just on overall, the engagement trends, our products are widely used
by teens, but we are facing tough competition from the likes of TikTok particularly
and Snapchat.
And we're focused on obviously continuing to innovate and roll out products like
Reels and attract the younger demographics and retain the younger demographics
for our products. And that's why we're continuing to build and invest in those areas.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mr.
Mahaney, your line is open. Please proceed.
Mark Mahaney: I apologize. Two questions. On the iOS changes, is it fair to say that, that's the
majority -- that accounts for the majority of the headwinds that you saw in Q3 and
expect to see in Q4?
And then secondly, a question for Mark. Just on the application of artificial
intelligence to kind of help moderate content is the wrong word, but to try to make
sure that inappropriate content is removed from Facebook and Instagram, et cetera.
Where do you think you are in terms of getting that to be where you want it to be? I
know it's been a multiyear investment journey experience. Here we are several
years later, is this a Sisyphean in task? Do you think you've been able to show
success in using AI constructively? Thank you.
Dave Wehner: Hey Mark, it's Dave. On the first question, yes, the Apple platform changes were the
largest factor in terms of Q3 headwinds. 
16
I mean it was really the first full quarter impact of those new ATT policy changes
following just the increased consumer adoption ramp of the iOS updates. And if it
really weren't for that, we would have expected sequential growth Q2 to Q3. So that
was the largest headwind in the quarter.
Mark Zuckerberg: Sure. I can speak a bit to AI. So my answer is, yes, I think it's made a big impact. We
issue these quarterly transparency reports, which I should add we're industryleading on this both in terms of defining this and in terms of the depth of what we
outline so that people can hold us accountable and kind of see the breakdown of
how we're actually doing.
But what we measure in those reports and disclose is what percent of the content
that we act on is our AI or our internal systems finding rather than people having to
report it. Because we have a lot of people who use our products if they find
something that's problematic and they report stuff to us.
And it used to be before the last several years that most of what we did for
community integrity was just respond to incoming reports, but we decided, hey, we
should really try to get in front of this and build really sophisticated systems so that
we're not just relying on people to tell us when there are issues, but we can
proactively go address that.
And in most of these categories and we've basically gotten to the point now where
90-plus percent of the content where we’re basically -- that we act on, we’re
identifying largely through the AI system. It varies a bit by category. So for
categories like nudity where it’s relatively easier to train a computer to identify that,
the numbers are very high. Some of the categories like hate speech that have been
harder because, first of all, we're operating in, I think it's around, 150 languages
around the world.
I also think it's -- there's a lot of cultural nuance in this where you want to be able to
make sure you understand the innuendos in all those languages and that you want
to make sure that people can say -- can denounce racism, right? If someone is saying
something racist to encourage someone to do something hateful, that's bad. But if
you -- if someone wants to basically say, hey, I saw this person doing this and people
shouldn't be doing that, then you don't want to sensor people doing that.
So it is being a very challenging problem. And for the first couple of years working
on this, we're still at a relatively low recall rate where our AI systems had 10%, 15%
of the content that we were addressing, we were dealing with proactively. But in
recent years, the AI progress has been very impressive. We're now above 90% of the
content that we take an action on there, is also proactive even with hate speech.
So overall -- I mean, look, let me take this question in a slightly different direction,
which is I know that there is a lot of scrutiny of our efforts. And I guess I just want to
say to the team and the people who work on this that I'm really proud of the 
17
progress that they make. I think we have the best people in the world, and we're
doing the best job of this, I believe, across any company in the industry.
And I think this is an important area. There should be scrutiny on it, but I also think
that any honest account of what's actually going on here should take into account
that a huge amount of progress has been made and will continue to be made by a
lot of talented people who are working on this.
Operator: Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ross Sandler: Thanks. Dave, one nitpicky question on the guide and then one kind of big picture
for Sheryl maybe. So since we're now all focusing on the 2-year CAGRs for the
guidance for the high end of the fourth quarter revenue actually has an acceleration
on the 2-year CAGR.
So I know we're talking about headwinds and IDFA and supply chains and everything
like that, but the sequential growth looks normal, and then that 2-year CAGR is
accelerating.
So I guess, where is the strength coming from? And would you call that a strong 4Q
environment? And then, Sheryl, you talked about overhauling targeting longer term
to have less focus on users or user-based targeting and more contextual and kind of
other things.
I guess, high level, how do you think that will impact the overall return on ad spend
compared to pre-IDFA levels? And as you look at Facebook's competitive position in
the digital ad market versus some of the other large platforms, like any impact on
the long term as you kind of retool the targeting? Thanks a lot.
Dave Wehner: Hey Ross, it's Dave. We're giving sort of specific quantitative revenue guidance on
Q4. I think if you look at the range, it's from a sequential growth basis on a seasonal
basis Q3 to Q4, it's lower sequential growth than we've seen historically.
So I do think that reflects some of the uncertainty that we're seeing out there as it
relates to how IDFA -- sorry, with the iOS 14 and ATT and IDFA impacts play into
pricing during the holidays and also the macroeconomic factors like the supply chain
issues. So I do think that kind of the seasonal sequential growth is lower than we've
seen in the past. And with the range, I think that reflects that uncertainty.
Sheryl Sandberg: In terms of the overall targeting, I think it's hard to sit here and decide exactly
where we're going to end up at the all of this. It is going to be a multiyear effort.
We've definitely seen a hit already, and we're definitely focused on tools to help
advertisers.
We think we have opportunities to strengthen targeting ourselves, both by the work
we do ourselves and as part of industry consortium. You're right in your question in
that advertisers have to make a choice of where they advertise. So the question for
us is, how good can our targeting be compared to others?
18
I think our targeting can suffer compared to others like Apple who have the direct
data themselves, but I think our targeting still remains, I think, in very, very many
ways, very good for advertisers. When you compare us on ROI, we've always
performed well. We still do even though we've taken a hit, and we're focused on
continuing to do that for businesses.
Operator: Our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please go ahead.
John Blackledge: Great, thanks. Two questions. First on the macro, are you already seeing supply
chain issues impacting 4Q ad revenue or do you expect them -- the issues to be
more impactful later in the quarter?
And then second question on Instagram. Given the rise of Reels, is it cannibalizing
engagement on the other Instagram services? Thank you.
Dave Wehner: Yes, John. I mean it's -- look, we're not the macroeconomic authority on all things. I
would tell you that what we're hearing from advertisers is they are seeing supply
chain issues. That was true in Q3 and had an impact there as well as we expect that
to continue to carry over into Q4.
They're also -- obviously that intersects with the challenges with the targeting and
measurement headwinds from iOS 14. So it's hard to parse exactly how the platform
issues and the macroeconomic factors will play into Q4, but I think those are the
two biggest factors driving the range of potential outcomes that we've outlined in
our guidance.
In terms of Reels and other IG services, I can take a crack at that, and then if Mark
and Sheryl want to add anything. Whenever we launch new experiences, this was
true with Stories, it was true with Facebook Watch. It's -- you're always going to see
some amount of shifting of people's time and attention to the new areas.
And we do think that, that benefits the experience overall, and we think that makes
the overall experience more engaging over time. And we do think that it's -- we're
able to with Reels drive incremental engagement with Instagram and Facebook. So
that's why we're investing to do that. You can go to the next questions.
Operator: From the line of Mark Shmulik with AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead.
Mark Shmulik: Yes, hi. One for Sheryl, specifically around kind of on-platform commerce and that
pivot, and I know previously you've shared kind of merchant and user adoption
metrics, but any progress you could share on that front as it relates to activity? Are
users embracing it?
And then the second question kind of more broadly around recruiting. I know the
recent post to create kind of 10,000 jobs tied to the metaverse in Europe. Any
particular kind of rationale for how you're thinking about recruiting kind of globally?
Thanks.
19
Sheryl Sandberg: So on commerce, we have a lot of commerce activity on our platform already.
People are discovering lots of products through our Feed and Stories ads. This is our
largest ad vertical, and COVID really accelerated it. But it’s also been one of the
fastest-growing verticals over a 5-year period.
We believe we drive hundreds of billions of dollars of off-site e-commerce gross
merchandise volume today through our ads business. And we think commerce tools
will be built and layered on top of that to help businesses reach more new
customers and drive more incremental sales.
In those commerce efforts, we're focused on three areas, continuing to be the best
place to advertise, making it easier to sell on the platform, and improving the
customer experience. And I think we're in different places on those. In the first, in
terms of continuing to be the best place to advertise, we are a great place to find
customers. We think the ROI is very strong, and it continues to be competitive.
In terms of making it easier, the second, to sell on the platform, here, we're catching
up to other mobile and web shopping experiences. And I think we have some work
to do there. And then the third, improving the consumer experience to encourage
people to shop, I think we're also making progress there, but we've got some room
to grow.
Dave Wehner: And Mark, on the recruiting front, obviously, we've got a big investment year
planned in 2022. That's going to be largely driven by recruiting. We're going to have
to do that globally. We're looking to build technical talent. We're going to be hiring
people to do more remote work and focusing on that.
We're going to be investing in headcount outside of the Bay Area and continuing to
focus on building our technical and product capabilities across the globe. Europe is
an important part of that, and that's why it was outlined in that announcement.
Deborah Crawford: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Very good. Our last question then will be from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.
Please go ahead.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Dave, just on the CapEx at the midpoint over 70%, there are a lot of
questions just as it relates to what the surge is related to there. Is there any more
detail you can help us better understand that investment?
Dave Wehner: Yes. Sure, Brent. I mean I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our 2022 outlook
really reflects a significant increase in our planned investment in areas like AI and
machine learning. And a lot of that will be dedicated to investing in areas where we
can use machine learning to improve ranking and recommendations to power
experiences across our products in areas like Feed and in emerging areas like Reels. 
20
We'll also be dedicating that to ads as we work to improve ads relevance and
leveraging machine learning and AI to help balance out the loss of signal that we've
experienced from some of the platform changes.
So we think that we can, as part of sort of making our ads even more effective,
make up for that loss with the large investments on the machine learning and AI
side. And I think our position gives us a good ability to do that. So that's really part
of the logic behind the big increase in the CapEx budget next year.
Deborah Crawford: Great. Thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look
forward to speaking with you again.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now
disconnect your lines.
