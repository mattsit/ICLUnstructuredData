Mark Zuckerberg, CEO
Hey everyone and thanks for joining us today.
2022 was a challenging year, but I think we ended it having made good progress on our main priorities
and setting ourselves up to deliver better results this year as long as we keep pushing on efficiency. I
said last quarter that I thought our product trends look better than most of the commentary out there
suggests. I think that's even more the case now. We reach more than 3.7 billion people monthly across
our family of apps. On Facebook, we now reach 2 billion daily actives and almost 3 billion monthly. The
number of people daily using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is the highest it's ever been.
Before getting into our product priorities, I want to discuss my management theme for 2023, which is
the "year of efficiency". We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams.
When we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end.
Since then, we've taken some additional steps like working with our infrastructure team on how to
deliver our roadmap while spending less on capex. Next, we're working on flattening our org structure
and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster, as well as deploying AI tools
to help our engineers be more productive. As part of this, we’re going to be more proactive about
cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial, but my main focus is on
increasing the efficiency of how we execute our top priorities.
I think there's going to be some more that we can do to improve our productivity, speed, and cost
structure, and by working on this over a sustained period I think we'll both build a stronger technology 
2
company and become more profitable. I am very focused on doing this in a way that helps us build
better products, and because of that, even if our business outperforms our goals, this will stay our
management theme for the year so I think it’s going to make us a better company. At the same time, I'm
also focused on delivering better financial results than what we've reported recently and on meeting the
expectation that I outlined last year of delivering compounding earnings growth even while investing
aggressively in future technology.
Next, I want to give some updates on our priority areas. Our priorities haven't changed since last year.
The two major technological waves driving our roadmap are AI today and over the longer term the
metaverse.
First, let's talk about our AI discovery engine. Facebook and Instagram are shifting from being organized
solely around people and accounts you follow to increasingly showing more relevant content
recommended by our AI systems. This covers every content format -- which is something that makes our
services unique -- but we're especially focused on short-form video since Reels is growing so quickly. I'm
really proud of our progress here. Reels plays across Facebook and Instagram have more than doubled
over the last year, while the social component of people resharing Reels has grown even faster and has
more than doubled on both apps in just the last 6 months.
The next bottleneck that we're focused on to continue growing Reels is improving monetization
efficiency, or the revenue that’s generated per minute of Reels watched. Currently, the monetization
efficiency of Reels is much less than feed, so the more that Reels grows, even though it adds
engagement to the system overall, it takes some time away from feed and we actually lose money. But
people want to see more Reels though, and the key to unlocking that is improving our monetization
efficiency so that we can show more Reels without losing increasing amounts of money. We're making
progress here, and our monetization efficiency on Facebook has doubled in the past six months. In
terms of the revenue headwind, we're still on track to be roughly neutral by the end of this year or
maybe early next year, and after that we should be able to profitably grow Reels while keeping up with
the demand that we see.
In our broader ads business, we’re continuing to invest in AI and we're seeing our efforts pay off here. In
the last quarter, advertisers saw over 20% more conversions than in the year before. And combined
with a declining cost per acquisition, this has resulted in higher returns on ad spend.
We continue to be excited about the monetization opportunity with business messaging too. Facebook
and Instagram are the first two pillars of our business, and in the next few years we hope to bring
messaging online as the next pillar. One way of doing this is click-to-message ads, which is now at a $10
billion run rate.
Paid messaging is the other piece of this. We're earlier here, but we continue to onboard more
businesses to the WhatsApp Business Platform, where they can answer customer questions, send
updates, and sell directly in chat. For example, AirFrance started using WhatsApp to share boarding
passes and other flight information in 22 countries and in 4 languages. Businesses often tell us that more
people open their messages and they get better results on WhatsApp than other channels.
AI is the foundation of our discovery engine and our ads business – and we also think it's going to enable
many new products and additional transformations within our apps. Generative AI is an extremely 
3
exciting new area with so many different applications, and one of my goals for Meta is to build on our
research to become a leader in generative AI in addition to our leading work in recommendation AI.
The last area that I want to talk about is the metaverse. We shipped Quest Pro at the end of last year,
and I'm really proud of it. It's the first mainstream mixed reality device, and we're setting the standard
for the industry with our Meta Reality system. As always, the reason why we're focused on building
these platforms is to deliver better social experiences than what's possible today on phones. The value
of MR is that you can experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the
physical world around you. We're already seeing developers build out some impressive new experiences
like Nanome for 3D modeling molecules and drug development, Arkio for architects and designers to
create interiors, and of course a lot of great games. The MR ecosystem is relatively new, but I think it's
going to grow a lot in the next few years. Later this year, we're going to launch our next generation
consumer headset, which will feature Meta Reality as well, and I expect that this is going to establish
this technology as the baseline for all headsets going forward, and eventually of course for AR glasses as
well.
Beyond MR, the broader VR ecosystem continues growing. There are now over 200 apps on our VR
devices that have made more than $1 million in revenue.
We're also continuing to make progress with avatars. We just launched avatars on WhatsApp last
quarter and more than 100 million people have already created avatars in the app. Of those, about one
in five are using their avatar as their WhatsApp profile photo. I thought that was an interesting example
of how the Family of Apps and metaverse visions come together. Because even though most of our
Reality Labs investment is going towards future computing platforms -- glasses, headsets, and the
software to run them -- as the technology develops, most people are going to experience the metaverse
for the first time on phones and start building up their digital identities across our apps.
Alright, so those are the areas we're focused on: AI, including our discovery engine, ads, business
messaging, and increasingly generative AI, and the future platforms for the metaverse. From an
operating perspective, we're focused on efficiency and continuing to streamline the company so we can
execute these priorities as well as possible and build a better company while improving our business
performance.
As always, I'm grateful to our teams for your work on all of these important areas, and to all of you for
being on this journey with us. And now, over to Susan.
Susan Li, CFO
Thanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.
Let’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise
noted.
Q4 total revenue was $32.2 billion, down 4% or up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Had
foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been
approximately $2.0 billion higher.
Q4 total expenses were $25.8 billion, up 22% compared to last year.
4
In terms of the specific line items:
Cost of revenue increased 31%, driven mostly by a write-down of certain data center assets as well as
growth in infrastructure-related costs.
R&D increased 39%, Marketing & Sales increased 4%, and G&A decreased 7%.
Operating lease impairments and employee-related costs were the largest contributors to growth for all
three expense lines.
However, growth in Marketing and Sales was partially offset by lower marketing spend, and growth in
G&A was more than fully offset by a decrease in legal-related expenses.
We ended the fourth quarter with over 86,400 employees, which includes a substantial majority of the
approximately 11,000 employees impacted by our previously announced layoff who remained on payroll
as of December 31st due to applicable legal requirements. We expect the vast majority of impacted
employees will no longer be captured in our reported headcount figures by the end of the first quarter
of 2023.
Fourth quarter operating income was $6.4 billion, representing a 20% operating margin.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 24%.
Net income was $4.7 billion or $1.76 per share.
Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.2 billion, driven by
investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure.
Free cash flow was $5.3 billion and we ended the year with $40.7 billion in cash and marketable
securities. In the fourth quarter we repurchased $6.9 billion of our Class A common stock, bringing our
total share repurchases for the full year to $27.9 billion. We had $10.9 billion remaining on our prior
authorization as of December 31st and today we announced a $40 billion increase in our stock
repurchase authorization.
Moving now to our segment results.
I’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment.
Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 2.96
billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in December, and that
approximately 3.74 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis.
Facebook continues to grow globally and engagement remains strong. We reached 2.00 billion Facebook
daily active users for the first time in December, up 4% or 71 million compared to last year. DAUs
represented approximately 67% of the 2.96 billion monthly active users in December. MAUs grew by 51
million or 2% compared to last year.
5
Q4 Total Family of Apps revenue was $31.4 billion, down 4% year over year.
Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $31.3 billion, down 4% but up 2% on a constant currency basis.
Consistent with our expectations, Q4 revenue remained under pressure from weak advertising demand,
which we believe continues to be impacted by the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape.
The financial services and technology verticals were the largest negative contributors to the year-overyear decline in Q4, but both have relatively smaller shares of our revenue. Growth remained negative in
our largest verticals, online commerce and CPG, though the pace of y/y decline in online commerce has
slowed compared to last quarter. The largest positive contributors to year-over-year growth in Q4 were
the travel and healthcare verticals, though both are relatively smaller verticals in absolute share.
Foreign currency remained a significant headwind to advertising revenue growth in all international
regions. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 5%. North
America was flat while Asia-Pacific and Europe declined 3% and 16%, respectively.
In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 23% and the average
price per ad decreased 22%. Impression growth was primarily driven by the Asia-Pacific and Rest of
World regions. The year-over-year decline in pricing was primarily driven by strong impression growth,
especially from lower monetizing surfaces and regions, lower advertiser demand and foreign currency
depreciation. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we have continued to
make improvements to our ads targeting and measurement that we believe are driving more
conversions and better returns for advertisers.
Family of Apps other revenue was $184 million in Q4, up 19%, with strong business messaging revenue
growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform partially offset by a decline in other line items.
We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our
Family of Apps. In Q4, Family of Apps expenses were $20.8 billion, representing 81% of our overall
expenses. FoA expenses were up 23% due primarily to restructuring-related expenses and growth in
infrastructure-related costs.
Family of Apps operating income was $10.7 billion, representing a 34% operating margin.
Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $727 million, down 17% due to lower Quest 2 sales.
Reality Labs expenses were $5.0 billion, up 20% due primarily to employee-related costs and
restructuring-related expenses.
Reality Labs operating loss was $4.3 billion.
Before turning to the outlook, I’d like to discuss our work to grow profitability by scaling monetization
and improving our operational efficiency.
There are two primary levers to increasing monetization - growing supply and growing demand. 
6
Growing ad supply gives businesses more opportunities to get in front of people, and we are focused on
enabling that in a couple of ways. First and foremost, we remain focused on building engaging
experiences for the people who use our apps. We are coming into 2023 with a strong foundation as
Reels continues to scale and we’re seeing in-feed recommendations contribute to engagement as we
help people discover new content in their feeds. We will continue to invest in making these experiences
best in class. The other side of growing supply comes from more effectively monetizing the surfaces
within our apps, including those that have a lower level of ads today. In the nearer-term, ramping Reels
monetization remains a primary focus. Over the longer-term we see opportunities to continue
improving Facebook and Instagram monetization while also scaling revenue contributions from our
messaging platforms.
Growing advertising demand is the other focus, and a big effort here is around continuing to drive
advertiser performance. While we are still contending with the broader macro uncertainty and signals
landscape weighing on advertiser demand in the near-term, we are making good progress on our
roadmap and are already seeing improvements to ad performance and measurement from the
investments we’ve made.
We see opportunities for continued gains in the near- and medium-term, with our AI investments
powering a lot of this work as we continue to improve ads ranking and enable increased automation for
advertisers to make it easier for them to run campaigns and use our systems to optimize their
performance. Another opportunity we have is to further scale onsite conversions through products like
click-to-message, lead ads and Shop ads. Click-to-message ads continue to grow quickly and we believe
they’re bringing incremental demand onto our platform, with over half of Click-to-Message advertisers
exclusively using click-to-messaging ads on our platform. We see further opportunity as we continue to
scale click-to-WhatsApp ads and are investing in growing newer formats like Shop ads.
Over the long-term, we’re investing heavily in AI to develop and deploy privacy-enhancing technologies
and continue building new tools that will make it easier for advertisers to create and deliver more
relevant and engaging ads.
Moving now to our efficiency work. We took significant actions in 2022 to operate more efficiently. In
Q4, we made the difficult decision to layoff employees while de-prioritizing certain projects and
curtailing non headcount-related expenses. We have applied the same scrutiny to our physical assets.
We identified opportunities to consolidate our office facilities and, we have streamlined our future data
centers to a new architecture which we believe will be more cost efficient and more flexible that
provides us optionality to support both AI and non-AI workloads. In Q4, we recorded $4.2 billion of total
restructuring costs in connection with all of these efforts, and expect there to be some additional costs
in 2023 in areas like office facilities impairments as we continue this work.
As Mark has said, these actions are just the beginning of our efficiency efforts and we remain keenly
focused on this in 2023. We are working across the company to de-prioritize lower ROI work, move
faster, increase productivity and reduce costs across the business. As part of this, we are carefully
scrutinizing our hiring needs, actively re-evaluating projects, and reducing management layers. I am
confident our company-wide focus on efficiency will position us to be an even more productive
organization going forward.
Turning now to the revenue outlook.
7
We expect first quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $26-28.5 billion. Our guidance assumes
foreign currency will be an approximately 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the
first quarter, based on current exchange rates.
Turning now to the expense outlook.
We anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $89-95 billion, lowered from our
prior outlook of $94-100 billion due to slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of
revenue. We now expect to record an estimated $1 billion in restructuring charges in 2023 related to
consolidating our office facilities footprint. This is down from our prior estimate of $2 billion as we
recorded a portion of the charges in the fourth quarter of 2022. We may incur additional restructuring
charges as we progress further in our efficiency efforts.
Turning now to the capex outlook for 2023.
We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $30-33 billion, lowered from our prior estimate of
$34-37 billion. The reduced outlook reflects our updated plans for lower data center construction spend
in 2023 as we shift to a new data center architecture that is more cost efficient and can support both AI
and non-AI workloads. Substantially all of our capital expenditures continue to support the Family of
Apps.
On to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2023 tax rate percentage to be in
the low twenties.
In addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of
transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations.
In closing, 2022 was a challenging but pivotal year for our business. We made important progress on our
priorities and have taken significant steps to improve our efficiency and productivity. We are set up well
to build on this work in 2023 as we continue investing for future growth while remaining focused on
delivering strong financial performance.
With that, Dave, let’s open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. To ask a
question, press one followed by the number four on your touchtone phone. Please
pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If you are
streaming today’s call, please mute your computer speakers. Your first question
comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak: Great, thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Mark, one for Susan.
Mark, the first one is on generative AI. I sort of wanted to dig a little more into how
you think about your blue sky potential user and advertiser use cases of generative
AI? And how do you think about the timeline for when we can foresee some
glimpses of those on the platform?
And then the second one for Susan. Just any more color on the new data center
architecture and how we should think about the long-term capital intensity of the 
8
business, whether it's CapEx per minute, CapEx per DAU? How big of a long-term
benefit could this change be to the overall cash flow? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg: Yes, I can start with generative AI. I think this is a really exciting area. And I mean, I'd
say the two biggest themes that focused on for this year and one is efficiency and
then the new product area is going to be the generative AI work.
We have a bunch of different work streams across almost every single one of our
products to use the new technologies, especially the large language models and
diffusion models for generating images and videos and avatars and 3D assets and all
kinds of different stuff across all of the different work streams that we're working
on, as well as over the long term, working on things that could really empower
creators to be way more productive and creative across the apps and run a lot of
different accounts.
So I think that there's some really exciting stuff here. I want to be careful not to get
too far ahead of the development of it. So I think you'll see us launch a number of
different things this year, and we'll talk about them, and we'll share updates on how
they're doing. I do expect that the space will move quickly. I think we'll learn a lot
about what works and what doesn't. A lot of the stuff is expensive, right, to kind of
generate an image or a video or a chat interaction.
These things we're talking about, like cents or fraction of a cent. So one of the big
interesting challenges here also is going to be how do we scale this and make this
work more efficient so that way we can bring it to a much larger user base. But I
think once we do that, there are going to be a number of very exciting use cases. I
realize this is a pretty high-level answer for now, but I think that we'll be able to
share more details over the coming months.
Susan Li: Thanks, Brian. On your questions about CapEx. So your first question was about the
new data center architecture that we talked about, which is underpinning the lower
CapEx outlook. So we're shifting our data centers to a new architecture that can
more efficiently support both AI and non-AI workloads. And that's going to give us
more optionality as we better understand our demand for AI over time.
Additionally, we're expecting that the new design will be cheaper and faster to build
than previous data center architecture.
Along with the new data center architecture, we're going to optimize our approach
to building data centers. So we have a new phased approach that allows us to build
base plans with less initial capacity and less initial capital outlay, but then flex up
future capacity quickly if needed. We're still planning to grow AI capacity
significantly, and that connects, I think, to a lot of the things that Mark was
describing earlier in his question.
In terms of longer-run capital intensity, we certainly expect that the lower CapEx
outlook will have some incremental benefit to CapEx as a percent of revenue, and
that's still really something that we are focused on over the longer term. The 
9
current surge in CapEx is really due to the building out of AI infrastructure, which we
really began last year and are continuing into this year.
We'll be measuring the ROI of these AI investments, and their returns will continue
to inform our future spend. Our intention is still to bring CapEx as a percent of
revenue down, but capital intensity in the nearest term is really going to depend, in
part, on the revenue outlook and our needs to further build AI capacity for future
demand.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your
line is open.
Eric Sheridan: Thank you so much. Maybe I can ask a multiparter on going back to some of your
comments on Reels. Mark, you’ve always had this philosophy of letting the user sort
of continue to grow engagement, and monetization has always lagged sort of
consumer adoption of new products. How do you think about going a little bit
deeper on the mixture of letting the engagement of short-form video continue to
build versus eventually sort of continuing to drive higher levels of monetization
against that product?
Second, can you give us a little bit of color of how advertiser conversations continue
to evolve around short-form video and the adoption of the Canvas and the
utilization of that as a means to deliver a mixture of brand and DR messages?
And then lastly would just be, can you quantify at all the gap that still exists
between the engagement around short-term video and the monetization and how
that might close as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks so much.
Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. I mean the way I've always looked at -- I can take the first part of this, is that for
these consumer products, often building up and scaling the product use case is a
somewhat different discipline than working on the monetization. So it's such a kind
of hard problem to build these new types of products that you want to give the
teams as much clarity and as simple of goals as possible. So in the beginning, just
saying, okay, just let's make something that works for people.
And then once we get to many hundreds of millions of people or billions of people
using it, then we'll focus on ramping up the monetization, which has been a formula
that's worked for us. That's the general approach. Now with Reels, we do have a lot
of people using it now. So I think at this point, the question is, is there any strategic
advantage to letting it scale further than will be -- than would be profitable to do?
And I think at the scale that it's at right now, it's not clear that there's much
strategic advantage. I mean there are certain flywheels, and you get certain more
feedback or data points from a little bit more distribution. But at this point, we're at
pretty good scale. So I think for now, the right thing to do is to work on
monetization efficiency. 
10
And we know that there is demand to see some more Reels. And as we naturally
improve the monetization efficiency, which I have confidence in because the teams
are doing good work, and that's been working, I shared the stat about it, the
efficiency doubling over the last 6 months on Facebook, I think as we can continue
some of those trends, then we'll naturally just unlock the ability to show more and
more Reels, and we'll continue to grow from there.
But that's the overall approach. I do think that our philosophy of building these
consumer products, focusing on getting them to hundreds of millions or billions of
people and then focusing on monetization beyond that and bringing that in as the
balance is the right approach. It’s served us well.
You can expect us to continue doing that on future things that we do, including
some -- hopefully, some of the new generative AI products or some of the new
Metaverse stuff that we're doing. We're going to take the same approach there as
well.
Javier Olivan: So, on the advertisers’ reaction to Reels, we continue working on enabling more
advertisers to participate in Reels ads, more formats, more objectives, more tools to
create them. And we've been making good progress with now over 40% of our
advertisers use Reels ads across our apps.
And between Direct Response versus brand, we're actually seeing progress with
both. But Direct Response continues to be where advertisers are focused. And just
as an example, Outlet City, which is a German fashion retailer, developed creatives
specifically for Reels to test the impact of conversions. And they found that Reels
resulted in a 19x higher ROAS, 89% lower cost per purchase and 9x higher lift in
sales. So overall, very good results.
Susan Li: On your third question, Eric, we are not quantifying the gap in monetization
efficiency between Reels and other services. We know it took us several years to
bring the gap close between Stories and Feed Ads.
And we expect that this will take longer for Reels. Having said that, we are still
roughly on track to bring the overall Reels revenue headwind to a neutral place by
the end of this year or early next year, and we're planning to do that through both
improving Reels monetization efficiency and growing incremental engagement from
Reels.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is
open.
Mark Shmulik: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I've got a couple as well. First one, I don’t know
for Susan or Javier. As we think about -- I appreciate the color on improving
conversion rate. Would it be fair to say that you're kind of through the other side of
some of those IDFA headwinds we've been talking about for the last year or so? And
any more color just kind of that journey of the AI-driven adage would be
appreciated.
11
And secondly, Mark, kind of diving in that annual theme of efficiency and following
on Boz's post, what's the right way to think about long-term investment intensity in
Reality Labs and kind of balancing that with the ambitions to build the next
computing platform? Is this the right intensity of kind of where you're at right now
to think about? Or are there any milestones we should be looking for? Thanks.
Susan Li: Thanks, Mark. So on your first question, we are continuing to make progress in
mitigating the impact from the ATT change. But this is more generally just the reality
of the online advertising environment that we operate in now. So we're continuing
to work on building tools that mitigate the impact of those changes, and we see
strong adoption of those tools, including tools we've talked about before like CAPI,
CAPI Gateway, et cetera.
We're also investing in ways to bring conversions on-site, and we have a lot of ad
formats that have been instrumental in doing so across both click-to-messaging ads,
lead ads and Shop ads being formats that bring conversions on-site. And then over
the longer run, we're continuing to invest in our privacy-enhancing technologies to
more fundamentally enable us to deliver more performant and privacy-safe ads to
advertisers. Javi, is there anything you want to add on that?
Javier Olivan: Yes. And I think, Susan, you touched on most of it. I think if you look at the strategy
on ads, we really have two parts, which is continue investing in AI, and that's where
we're seeing a lot of the improvement in ads relevance. And as Mark was saying, we
saw over 20% more conversions than in the prior year, which, combined with the
decline in cost per acquisition, results on higher ROAS. We also use it for automated
experiences for the advertisers, improvements on measurement, which allow
advertisers to do better budget decisions.
But the second part is bringing more conversions on-site, which are also obviously
helping offsetting this signal loss. Indeed, we're reframing the problem as a signal
growth opportunity. And one example would be lead ads where -- just to give
another example, Additive, which is an online marketing and sales automation
agency in Italy for hotels and resorts.
They used lead ads to collect a higher volume of qualified leads at a lower cost, so
basically compared to off-site leads, they managed to achieve a 2x more final
bookings with on-site leads, 4x more qualified leads with on-site leads and a 2.7x
lower cost per lead with on-site versus the alternative option in the lead acquisition
off-site.
Mark Zuckerberg: All right. And I can give some color on -- and I think there was a question about how
we're thinking about this efficiency theme as it applies to Reality Labs over time. I
guess there are two ways that I think this applies.
The first thing is, I think it's important to not just think about Reality Labs as one
thing, right? There are like three major areas, right? There's the augmented reality
work long term, which is actually the biggest area, but hasn't -- but it's still a large 
12
research problem. There is a lot of work there that we haven't actually shipped the
product yet. VR, which is starting to ramp, right, Quest 2, I think, did quite well. We
have multiple product lines there with the Quest Pro.
And then the smallest by kind of budget size today is the Metaverse software
program. And that's -- it doesn't reflect the importance of it. I think the software
and social platform might be the most critical part of what we're doing, but
software is just a lot less capital intensive to build than the hardware. So it's the
smallest part of the program. And within each of those areas, there are a lot of
different things that we're doing.
So just like any project that we would run, we're constantly learning from how the
products that we've shipped are doing, how the market is evolving overall, how
competitors are doing, and what reaction they're seeing to different things, and
what experiments are being played out. And we're kind of constantly tuning the
road map. And obviously, some of these are longer-term things, right?
So you start planning out the hardware that you're going to ship 2, 3 years in
advance. But we're kind of constantly looking at the signals and learning and making
decisions about what it makes sense to do forward. So that's definitely going to
continue.
And we will -- even though I'm -- none of the signals that I've seen so far suggests
that we should shift the Reality Labs strategy long term. We are constantly adjusting
the specifics of how we adjust -- of how we execute this. So I think that we'll
certainly look at that as part of the ongoing efficiency work.
The other piece is just different tactics, things like trying to flatten the org, things
like that. Those are going to apply across the whole company. So we expect that
within the road map that we're trying to execute, both on Reality Labs and Family of
Apps, we just want to focus on making all of our work more efficient. A lot of the
time, when people talk about efficiency, there's a lot of focus on prioritization and
which big things can you cut.
But I actually think what makes you a better company over time is being able to
execute and do more things because you're operating more efficiently, and you can
get things done with fewer resources.
So I'd like to kind of get us to that mode more, which I guess gets me to a higher
level point in this, which is I just think we're in -- we've entered somewhat of a
phase change for the company, where we just grew so quickly for like the first 18
years of the company's growth. And it's very hard to really crank on efficiency while
you're growing that quickly.
And I just think we're in a different environment now where we have a bunch of
areas that, I mean, are still extremely exciting and growing quickly for the future,
where I think the right strategy will be to focus on top-line growth. But I think a lot 
13
of what we do, it really just makes sense to really focus on the efficiency a lot more
than we had previously and making sure that we can do that work more effectively.
For what it's worth, I think if we do that well, it will be -- I think we'll be able to do
better product work. And I think it will be a more fun place for people to work
because I think they're going to get more stuff done. So I'm pretty committed to
this, and it's going to go across all of the different things that we're doing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is
open.
Douglas Anmuth: Great, thanks for taking the questions. Susan, I know the expense outlook came
down by $5 billion. I was just hoping you could talk about some of the areas where
you may be able to get increased efficiency still? And then what does the new
expense outlook suggest for hiring levels in '23? And then separately, I was hoping
you could comment on the issues in Europe around Meta's use of first-party data to
target ads. How could this get resolved? And how should we think about the risk to
Meta? Thanks.
Susan Li: I'll start with the 2023, the expense outlook. So the primary components of the
reduction in the 2023 expense outlook are across three areas. The first is slower
payroll growth. So we're continuing to scrutinize how we allocate resources across
the company on this. We have a broad hiring freeze in place right now. And we
continue to expect a slower pace of hiring in the year as we evaluate what roles
we're going to open.
I'll roll in the answer to your second question here, which is this is an ongoing
process for us. We don't presently have a hiring target to share for the end of the
year.
The second component of the lower expense outlook is on cost of revenue. We're
expecting slower growth. Depreciation here is impacted by us extending the useful
lives of non-AI servers in Q4.
And then the third component is our outlook now reflects an estimated $1 billion in
facilities consolidation charges. That's down from the prior $2 billion estimate that
we gave in the last guidance range since a portion of the previously estimated
charges were already recognized in Q4 2022. So those are really the big -- those are
really the primary issues as it pertains to the lower expense outlook.
Your second question was on the issues in Europe around Meta using data to target
ads. So I think if you're referring to the EU DPC ruling that we have to change our
approach regarding our reliance on contractual necessity as the legal basis for ads in
Europe, that's a decision -- we don't agree with it. We believe that our current
approach is GDPR compliant, and we're appealing the substance of the rulings and
the fines. We don't expect that those decisions are going to affect our ability to
provide personalized advertising in the EU, and that advertisers should be able to
continue to use our platforms to reach customers and grow their businesses.
14
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your
line is open.
Justin Post: Great, thank you. Maybe a follow-up on the privacy and data use. Are you still facing
headwinds in the first quarter? Or are you kind of past that from IDFA or ATT? And
then as you look out over the next year, anything on Android or in the EU with
Digital Markets Act? Or anything we should be thinking about or aware of? Thank
you.
Susan Li: Thanks, Justin. On ATT, I think what I would say is there is still certainly an absolute
headwind to our revenue number. That is the impact of the ATT changes being in
place. Having said that, we are lapping its rollout and adoption, and we're making
progress in mitigating the impact due to a lot of the work that both Javi and I just
talked about, including the different advertiser tools, including ad formats that bring
conversions on site and including the longer-term AI investments in privacyenhancing technologies.
The second part of your question was on, oh, anything from Android and other
headwinds. On Android, it's too early to know where this will land. I think Google is
taking an approach that is collaborating with the industry, which we think is critical,
and we'll have updates as more time elapses there.
And then your third -- the third part of your question, I think, was on regulatory
issues in the EU. I think this was on DSA. We are expecting -- we have been
preparing for some time to comply with DSA and meet the compliance deadlines
that we expect to come into effect this year. Those are a meaningful but
manageable segment of costs. We've been preparing for a long time, and those
costs have been factored already into our -- into our total expense guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of use of Youssef Squali with Truist. Your
line is open.
Youssef Squali: Great, thank you. Two questions for me, please. First, maybe one for Susan. Just
staying on the theme of the efficiency and with all the adjustments to your cost
basis lately, can you maybe just speak to the relationship you're trying to build
between revenue growth and OpEx, CapEx growth over time? I think the last time
we saw them move in tandem or close to each other was back in 2017.
So are you at a point where you'd want them to grow much closer to each other? Or
are we still in an investment mode and therefore, potentially margin compression
mode beyond just 2023?
And then maybe, Mark, can you just provide an update on kind of the health of the
broad digital ad space, especially for the SMB side and DR. Just curious if coming out
of Q4, you're incrementally bullish or you're still as cautious as you were 3 or 6
months ago. Thank you.
15
Susan Li: Thanks, I’m happy to take the first question. So certainly, the lower expense outlook
and CapEx outlook puts us in a better position in terms of financial performance for
this year. We are, I think, still -- we're focused on the goal that Mark outlined, I
think, last quarter of delivering compounding earnings growth, while enabling
aggressively in the future technology. And that continues to be the principle by
which we are -- by which we're guiding our financial plans.
The second question is on update -- on the health of the broader digital ad space. I
can take -- I can start with this, and Javi, you should feel free to jump in if you want
to add more color. Q4, for us, we saw -- the holiday season, for us, fell mostly within
our range of expectations.
Trends in online commerce modestly improved for us, which is encouraging, but
again, the growth was still negative year-over-year. So overall, I think this is still a
pretty volatile macro environment. It's early in the year to know how this will shape
up for 2023. And if there's anything, Javi, you'd like to add, you can jump in.
Javier Olivan: No, I think you covered it well, Susan.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is open.
Ronald Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit more around
the progress on the AI discovery engine in Reels. And we're seeing it in our own
usage in terms of content and categories and just getting more insights and content
that we'd like to see. But can you just talk about the added signal that Meta is
seeing and gaining here to produce this more relevant content across Reels to
Stories to Feed and maybe even to Messenger? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg: I'm not exactly sure what would be useful to share here. But in general, a lot of the
gains that we're seeing on the discovery engine overall, which we basically use to
refer to our AI recommendation system across Facebook and Instagram across all
different content types of which Reels is sort of a special case, and that's growing
the fastest with short-form video.
But a lot of this is -- I mean, there's not like one specific data type that's useful. A lot
of the trend that we're seeing here is, we're using larger models, which require
more computation. We've shifted the models from being more CPU-based to being
GPU-based. We've seen big improvements in the amount of time and engagement
that we've gotten. And we -- it's a little bit hard for us to predict exactly how much
we'll be able to continue tuning those and improving.
But from the experience that we've had so far, I would bet that there's still pretty
significant upside there. I know that you kind of asked about specific data points,
but I think that, that's really the theme that we're seeing. And that applies across
Reels and the rest of the discovery engine.
The one thing that I'd add, it's a little bit separate from your question, but we do
spend most of the time talking about Reels, so I think maybe it's worth giving some 
16
color on the rest of the discovery engine work, which is -- has also been doing quite
well and is much more incremental to the rest of the business because if people end
up being able to discover additional photos or links or groups or things like that in
Facebook or just interesting content across Instagram, then they're just more
engaged in the product.
And we already know how to monetize that content. So, that ends up being really
helpful both for the overall engagement, not very cannibalistic at all, and already
profitable. So that's -- we've spent less time talking about that because I get that
Reels is sort of the faster-growing area.
But we do still expect that as a percent of the overall feeds in Facebook and
Instagram, recommended content will continue growing. I don't know if it will be a
majority by the end of this year, but maybe it will be 30’s percent, 40%, something
in that zone, and continuing to grow because we can just find content that people
are going to be interested in that may not be from accounts that they've followed
directly. So hopefully, that’s some useful color on what we're seeing across those
efforts.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is
open.
John Blackledge: Great, thanks. Two questions. Just a follow-up on Reality Labs. Should we continue
to expect accelerating losses at Reality Labs in '23? And if so, should we expect
Reality Labs to be at peak op losses this year? And then second, Susan mentioned
Shop ads in the bucket of early monetization. Just any color there on how we might
see that scale this year. Thank you.
Susan Li: Yes. Sorry, I'll go ahead and take the first question about Realty Labs, and Javi, you
can take the second question on Shop ads. On Reality Labs, we still expect our full
year Reality Labs losses to increase in 2023, and we're going to continue to invest
meaningfully in this area given the significant long-term opportunities that we see.
It is a long-duration investment, and our investments here are underpinned by the
accompanying need to drive overall operating profit growth while we're making
these investments. I'll turn it to Javi on the Shop ads.
Javier Olivan: Yes. So in Q4, we continued to test Shop ads in the U.S., and we're seeing increased
performance by helping direct the consumer to the place where they're most likely
to purchase. So it's early to know, but we really finally saw product market fit in a
test. It's off a small base.
But to just give you a sense, we saw triple-digit growth in both revenue and
adoption across Q4. And we expect this growth to normalize to a lower level in
2023. And the Shop ads beta has a revenue run rate in the hundreds of millions of
dollars. So that gives you a small base. It's a small revenue run rate yet, but it's
growing rapidly. And we expect it to continue, but normalize to more lower levels in
2023.
17
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your
line is open.
Mark Mahaney: Thanks. Two questions, please. The click-to-messaging is now that $10 billion
revenue run rate. How do you think about the growth path for that going forwards?
And do you find that that's bringing in brand-new advertisers to Meta that you
hadn't seen before? Like who's coming in on that? And does that give you a new
growth path?
And then, Mark, if I could just ask you. This year of efficiency, it's almost like there's
been a journey going on since early last year when you talked about -- talking about
driving the business for growing operating profit. And I guess I just want to ask the
why question. I mean it's -- the markets obviously like what they're hearing from
you today and the changes.
But why the much greater focus on efficiency, not just tonight, but kind of over the
last 9 or 12 months with maybe a few hiccups. Like is it just the maturity of the
business? Is it just trying to take, not advantage of a crisis, but there is a crisis out
there in terms of the economy, and maybe that forced minds to think this way. Just
a little bit more color on the why. Thanks a lot.
Susan Li: Thanks. This is Susan. On the click-to-messaging ads, so we are -- this is one of our
fastest-growing ads products, and we believe that they're bringing incremental
demand onto our platform. I mentioned in my script that over half of click-tomessage advertisers exclusively use click-to-message ads on our platform.
In terms -- you asked how we're going to scale, and I think there are a couple of
dimensions. In terms of demand, I think the biggest piece here is getting more
businesses to adopt click-to-messaging ads via creating more entry points,
simplifying creation flows. We're trying to integrate with partners who can help
smaller businesses scale. So there's a lot of work going on there.
On the performance side, we're continuing to focus on just driving up the ROI that
advertisers get from click-to-messaging ads. We're trying to give advertisers the
ability to do more down-funnel optimization, create better in-thread experiences
and simplify flows that help them drive conversion.
And then ultimately, we're always focused on growing supply and in this case,
growing the business messaging ecosystem by creating more ways for people and
businesses to connect across our messaging apps. So I think an example of that
would be something like business directory search on WhatsApp. So it's an
opportunity we're very excited about and we've invested a lot in and we've seen
very healthy growth. I'll turn it to Mark on the efficiency question.
Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. So I mean, on the efficiency point, I think we come to it from a few places. I
mean one is just like the journey of the company. And for the first 18 years, I think
we grew at 20%, 30% compound or a lot more every year, right?
18
And then obviously, that changed very dramatically in 2022, where our revenue was
negative for the growth for the first time in the company's history. So that was a
pretty big step down. And we don't anticipate that that's going to continue, but I
also don't think it's going to necessarily go back to the way it was before. So I do
think this is a pretty rapid phase change there that I think just forced us to basically
take a step back and say, okay, we can't just treat everything like it's hyper growth.
There are going to be some areas that are going to be very rapidly growing or that
are very kind of future investments that we want to make. But we also have a lot of
things now that are -- just have a lot of people using them and support large
amounts of business and that we think we should operate somewhat differently. So
there's that piece of it. But the other part of it that I'd say is that as we’ve started
doing the work, I actually think it makes us better, right?
And that was somewhat unexpected, right? I kind of, historically, would have
thought that this would just occupy some amount of our mind space and that that
would be more of a trade-off against how we are able to build products and get
things done. But at this point, I'm actually fairly optimistic that there are a pretty
good road map of things that we can do that will just make us more efficient and
actually better able to build the things that we want.
Not all of them will help save money, right? So for example, focusing on AI tools to
help improve engineer productivity, it's not necessarily going to reduce costs.
Although over the long term, maybe it will make it so we can have fewer -- we just
hire less, right, and stay a smaller company for longer.
But I do think things like reducing layers of management just make it so information
flows better through the company and so you can make faster decisions. And I
think, ultimately, that will help us not only make better products, but I think it will
help us attract and retain the best people who want to work in a faster-moving
environment.
And so that honestly was a little bit surprising, right, that as we started digging into
this that the company would actually start to feel better to me. And I don't know
how long that will -- like how long the road map is, if things that we can continue to
do where that will be the case.
But I do think we have a good amount of things like that. So that's why I'm really
focused on this now. And I do want to continue to emphasize the dual goals here of
making the company a better technology company and increasing our profitability.
They're both important, but I think it's also really important to focus on the first one
of just making it a better company because that way, even if we outperform our
business goals this year, I just want to communicate, especially to people inside the
company that we're going to stick with this, because I think it's just going to make us
a better company over the long term. So I think that's it for now.
Deborah Crawford: Operator, we have time for one last question.
19
Operator: Thank you. That will come from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is
open.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Susan, for your Q1 guidance, can you just remind us all what your
embedded expectations are for market conditions, how you think about
seasonality? What's embedded in that guidance?
Susan Li: Thanks, Brent. For -- I mean, for Q1, we are -- our guidance range of $26 billion to
$28.5 billion corresponds to negative 7% to plus 2% year-over-year growth. And it
reflects a wide range of uncertainty given the continuation of the general macro
environment that we've been operating in.
Again, we are pleased with the core engagement trends that we've talked about and
the performance improvements that we're delivering for advertisers with our
monetization work and our investments in AI. And we expect FX to be less of a
headwind to year-over-year growth in Q1 than it was in Q4. But again, we are
keeping a close eye on advertising demand and on the ongoing macroeconomic
volatility.
Deborah Crawford: Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look
forward to speaking with you again.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now
disconnect your lines.
